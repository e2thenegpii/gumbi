#summary Installation procedures for Gumbi firmware and API

=Prerequisites=

        The Gumbi API is written in Python, and requires no additional modules
        outside of those included with the standard Python installation.

        The firmware is written in C, and must be built for the AVR architecture;
        thus, you must have the AVR cross-compiler and toolchain installed on
        your system in order to build the firmware.

        To install the firmware via the Makefile, you must also have the dfu-programmer
        utility installed. Alternately, you can install the firmware using the
        Atmel Flip utility.

        The majority of the API code is platform independant, and should work on
        most systems; currently however, it has only been tested under Linux.

=Installation Procedures=

        To install the Gumbi API modules and associated Gumbi utilities:
{{{
                $ cd src/python
                $ ./configure
                # make
}}}
        To install the firmware onto the Gumbi board:
{{{
                $ cd src/avr
                $ make
                # make install
}}}
        Note that prior to installing the Gumbi board firmware, you must first
        put the board into programming mode, by shorting the two RESET pins while
        also shorting the two PROGRAM pins together.
